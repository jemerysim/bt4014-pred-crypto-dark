# Predicting cryptocurrency prices from Dark Web Transactions

2016 was also a very active year for cryptocurrencies. New cryptocurrencies found use alongside Bitcoin (BTC), with the general offerings of Monero (XMR) seeing a huge surge in popularity. Monero was also known to be a lot more secure than Bitcoin, especially when it came to obfuscation. (Tomaino, 2017) Since it also does not utilise a public transaction ledger, it supports completely anonymous transactions. Zcash, another privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, had its speculation-hounded debut in 2016. In October, it was sitting on an outrageous valuation of $2M USD, though the following months saw a tumb.

With the current rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies, the aim of our project is to explore if drug sales on the Dark Web can affect the prices of cryptocurrencies. While some analysts have used ARIMA modelling and neural networks to accomplish this task, we will be conducting multivariate time series analysis to formulate models to predict these prices. Specifically, we will be forecasting the Closing Prices (USD) of Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) from Dark Web Transactions for the year 2016 and subsequently evaluate our models' accuracy. Relationships between the variables will also be explored in detail.
